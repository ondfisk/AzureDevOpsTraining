# Azure DevOps Training

This repository contains a set of [challenges](/challenges) to teach you how to use [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/).

## Notes

All challenges are best solved using [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) where you work together in pairs and switch roles at least every 30 minutes.

Challenges are for the most part *deliberately* vague - you have to think and discover how to do things yourself.

Steal as much as you want from the ChatGPT / Internet / Stack Overflow / GitHub Copilot. It's your responsibility to understand the stuff you steal.

You are also welcome to grab the code supplied under [`/resources`](/resources/).

`...` means fill in the blanks.
